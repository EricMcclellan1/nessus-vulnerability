# Vulnerability Management with Nessus on Sandbox Network

# Introduction

In this project, I install and configure Nessus Essentials to perform basic & credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 Hosts. During this process I follow the 6 Main Stages Of The Vulnerability Management Process (Discover, Prioritize, Assess, Report, Remediate, Verify) throughout each stage of scans. In turn, securing the sandbox networks from a plethora of critical (both high & medium) vulnerabilities that were open to attackers worldwide.


# Preparation

So, the first thing to do before downloading Nessus Essentials was to create a virtual machine in Azure. This can also be done in AWS, Vmware, etc.

During the creation of the virtual machine, I made sure it ran Windows 10. After creation each one I then made sure to create a new rule in the Networking section to allow any inbound/outbound connections for this project.

In addition, I disabled the firewall in the VM for the Windows 10 machine & verified connections from my host machine to make sure we get efficient results.

After this, I downloaded Nessus Essentials and made sure it was installed on my host computer (not our other vm network).


# Rating After 1st Scan (Initial Settings)

After running a basic Network scan on the windows 10 vm (no credentials) I got these results on vulnerabilities.

Varying from low to critical, comprising of SSL vulnerabilities to SMB signing that would allow a remote attacker to exploit a man in the middle attack on server.
