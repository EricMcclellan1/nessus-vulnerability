# Vulnerability Management with Nessus on Sandbox Network

# Introduction

In this project, I install and configure Nessus Essentials to perform basic & credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 Hosts. During this process I follow the 6 Main Stages Of The Vulnerability Management Process (Discover, Prioritize, Assess, Report, Remediate, Verify) throughout each stage of scans. In turn, securing the sandbox networks from a plethora of critical (both high & medium) vulnerabilities that were open to attackers worldwide.
